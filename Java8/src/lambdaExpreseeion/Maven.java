		-->It gets it from "Maven Repository" : it has all the files that it needs according to he need of the user.
		
		-->Earlier we used to download it manually but now Maven does it by itself
		--> Maven central repository
		repository: it is nothing but location and at times the company might want its own repository other than the MVN Repository
		
		
		for other than MVN Repository:

	Advantage of pom :
	if dependency a is dependency B and so on 
	we need not remember all of that.... Maven does it and downloads all the the dependencies..
