package MultiThreading;
//Why multiTreading is preferred over MultiProcessing (WHY) : 
//switching  btw one thread to another is easier and faster 
//local variable created would be independent and only that data has to be saved
//contact switching is costlier
//multithreading happens in JVM , Jvm decides which 

//CONTEXT SWITCHING it is a mechanism that enables the OS to switch from process to process

//Scheduling
//Preemptive Scheduling
//Non-preemptive scheduling//no longer exists



//BLOCKING CALL: 

//SUSPEND
//WAIT




//RUNNABBLE INTERFACE
//
//java can extend only one class
//implementing the Runnable interface helps here


//setPriority(int level)
//
//Some methods of thread class
//join()//this method waits fir a thread to terminate 
// Thread t = new ...........90()
//t.start()
//t.join()
//join() waits for the thread to die






//yield()
//isAlive()//to check if the run method is being executed ,if the thread is running or not
//sleep(0)
//currentThread()  //gives you the live reference 
//interrupt()
