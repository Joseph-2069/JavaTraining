////Assignment: Create two threads on MyQueue instance. MyQueue will have Queue of Shape objects.
////Thread1 will ask end-users for Shape and add that Shape to Queue and Thread will read Shapes from 
////front of the queue and print details of Shape and it's area and perimeter. 
////(Note: Thread that reads shape from Queue should wait if Queue is empty and another 
////Thread pushes Shape into it after taking it from end-user. Hint: need to synchro this 
////using Synchronized wait and notify calls)
